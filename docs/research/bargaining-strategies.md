# Tire Trading Bot Bargaining Strategies

## Dynamic Discount System

Our AI-powered chatbot implements a sophisticated dynamic discount system to negotiate tire prices with customers in a personalized way. This system is designed to maximize sales conversion while maintaining profitability.

## Discount Tiers

1. **Standard Discount**: 5-10% for any customer
2. **Volume Discount**: 15% for 4 or more tires
3. **Loyalty Discount**: Additional 5% for returning customers
4. **Seasonal Promotion**: Additional 8-10% during promotional periods
5. **Competitor Price Match**: Will match verified competitor prices plus an additional 5% discount

## Business Logic

The bargaining system accounts for:

- Current inventory levels
- Seasonal demand patterns
- Profit margin requirements
- Customer purchase history
- Competitor pricing intelligence
- Time-based promotions
- Minimum margin: 30% (will not discount below cost + 30%)
- Additional discounts require manager approval

## Negotiation Framework

The chatbot employs a multi-stage negotiation approach:

1. **Initial Greeting**: Establish rapport and understand customer needs
2. **Information Gathering**: Determine quantity, desired specifications
3. **First Offer**: Present standard discount (10-15%)
4. **Counteroffer Handling**: Prepared responses to common requests for better pricing
5. **Escalation Point**: Identify when to hold firm or when to make further concessions
6. **Close**: Facilitate conversion with limited-time offers

## Seasonal Considerations

- Deepest discounts in January and July (off-seasons)
- Reduced flexibility during peak seasons (October-December, April-May)
- Special promotions tied to weather events or holidays

## Customer Segmentation

### Price-Sensitive Customers
- Emphasize value-oriented brands
- Highlight total cost of ownership benefits
- Focus on warranty and durability

### Premium Customers
- Emphasize performance characteristics
- Focus on exclusive features and technologies
- Less price sensitivity, but still expect "insider" deals

### Commercial Customers
- Volume-based pricing by default
- Long-term relationship building
- Require volume discounts
- Set pricing expectations for repeat purchases

## Implementation Notes

This negotiation system should balance the following objectives:
1. Maximize conversion rates
2. Protect profit margins
3. Build customer loyalty
4. Create a personalized shopping experience
5. Respond dynamically to market conditions

## Performance Metrics

The effectiveness of bargaining will be measured by:
- Conversion rate increases
