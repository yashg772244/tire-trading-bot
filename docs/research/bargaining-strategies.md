# Tire Trading Bot - Bargaining Strategies

## Dynamic Discount System

Our AI-powered chatbot implements a sophisticated dynamic discount system to negotiate tire prices with customers in a personalized way.

### Discount Tiers

1. **Initial Discount**: 10% off retail price
2. **Bulk Purchase**: 15% off for sets of 4 tires
3. **Premium Brand Discount**: Maximum 20% for top-tier brands (Michelin, Bridgestone, Continental)
4. **Standard Brand Discount**: Maximum 25% for mid-tier brands
5. **Competitor Price Match**: Will match verified competitor prices plus an additional 5% discount
6. **Seasonal Promotions**: Additional 5-10% during peak seasons (winter/summer tire changeover periods)

### Negotiation Parameters

The bargaining system accounts for:

- Customer purchase history
- Current inventory levels
- Market demand for specific models
- Seasonal factors
- Competitor pricing
- Bulk purchase quantity
- Brand tier classification

### Price Floor

- Minimum margin: 30% (will not discount below cost + 30%)
- Additional discounts require manager approval

## Negotiation Algorithms

The chatbot employs a multi-stage negotiation approach:

1. **Initial Assessment**: Evaluate customer needs and price sensitivity
2. **Value Proposition**: Emphasize tire benefits that match customer priorities
3. **First Offer**: Present standard discount (10-15%)
4. **Concession Strategy**: Structured approach to offering better prices based on customer pushback
5. **Closing Techniques**: Time-limited offers and package deals to incentivize purchase
